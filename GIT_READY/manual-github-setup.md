# Manual GitHub Setup - Step by Step

## The Issue
The repository `https://github.com/homekrypto/hkt-platform.git` doesn't exist yet or you don't have access to it.

## Solution: Create Repository First

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/homekrypto
2. Click the green "New" button (or go to https://github.com/new)
3. Fill out:
   - **Repository name**: `hkt-platform`
   - **Description**: `HKT Platform - Real Estate Investment via Blockchain`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **IMPORTANT**: Don't check any of these boxes:
     - [ ] Add a README file
     - [ ] Add .gitignore  
     - [ ] Choose a license
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Your Code (Easiest Method)

Once the repository is created, GitHub will show you an empty repository page.

**Option A: Upload via Web Interface**
1. Look for "uploading an existing file" link on the empty repository page
2. Download your `hkt-platform-git-ready.tar.gz` file from Replit
3. Extract it on your computer
4. Drag all the extracted files into the GitHub upload area
5. Add commit message: "Initial commit: HKT Platform"
6. Click "Commit changes"

**Option B: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it)**
```bash
# After creating the repository on GitHub
tar -xzf hkt-platform-git-ready.tar.gz
cd hkt-platform-git-ready
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: HKT Platform"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/homekrypto/hkt-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
After uploading, you should see all your files in the repository:
- client/ folder
- server/ folder  
- package.json
- README.md
- All configuration files

## Alternative: Use Different Repository Name

If `hkt-platform` doesn't work, try:
- `homekrypto-platform`
- `hkt-token-platform`
- `real-estate-crypto-platform`

## Quick Test
To verify the repository exists before trying to connect:
1. Go to https://github.com/homekrypto/hkt-platform
2. If you see "404 - Not Found", the repository doesn't exist yet
3. If you see an empty repository, you can proceed with uploading

The key is to create the repository on GitHub's website first, then upload your code.
