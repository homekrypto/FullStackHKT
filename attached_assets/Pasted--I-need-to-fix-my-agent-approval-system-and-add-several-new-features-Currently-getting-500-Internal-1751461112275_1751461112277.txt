"I need to fix my agent approval system and add several new features. Currently getting 500 Internal Server Error when trying to approve/deny agents in my admin panel.

**CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:**
1. Agent approval/denial endpoints returning 500 error: {"message":"Internal server error"}
2. Need to debug the PATCH /api/admin/agents/:id/approve and /api/admin/agents/:id/deny endpoints
3. Check database connection and Drizzle ORM queries for agent status updates

**NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:**

**1. AGENT PAGE CREATION SYSTEM:**
When an agent is approved, automatically:
- Create a unique SEO-optimized page for each agent (URL: /agents/[agent-slug])
- Generate SEO-friendly meta tags including:
  * Title: "[Agent Name] - Crypto & Real Estate Investment Expert | HomeKrypto"
  * Description: "Invest in real estate with cryptocurrency through [Agent Name]. Professional crypto real estate investment services with HomeKrypto platform."
  * Keywords: "crypto real estate, cryptocurrency property investment, [Agent Name], HomeKrypto agent"
  * Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Page should include agent profile, investment services, and crypto real estate focus

**2. EMAIL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM:**
When agent page is created, send confirmation email containing:
- Congratulations message on approval
- Direct link to their new agent page
- Reminder to link back to homekrypto.com from their marketing materials
- HTML instructions for embedding HomeKrypto referral links
- Professional email template with HomeKrypto branding

**3. ADMIN PANEL ENHANCEMENTS:**
Add "Edit Agent Details" button in admin panel that allows:
- Modify agent profile information
- Update contact details and credentials
- Change agent status (active/inactive)
- Edit agent page content and SEO settings
- Preview agent page before publishing

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

**Database Updates Needed:**
- Add agent_pages table with fields: agent_id, slug, seo_title, seo_description, page_content, created_at
- Update real_estate_agents table with approval_date, page_url, is_active fields

**API Endpoints to Create/Fix:**
- Fix: PATCH /api/admin/agents/:id/approve
- Fix: PATCH /api/admin/agents/:id/deny  
- Add: GET /api/admin/agents/:id (get single agent details)
- Add: PUT /api/admin/agents/:id (update agent details)
- Add: GET /agents/:slug (public agent page)

**Email Integration:**
- Use existing Hostinger SMTP setup (support@homekrypto.com)
- Create professional HTML email template
- Include agent page link and marketing instructions

**Frontend Components:**
- Agent page template with SEO optimization
- Admin edit agent modal/form
- Email preview functionality in admin panel

**SEO IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Dynamic meta tag generation for each agent page
- URL slug generation from agent name
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for better search indexing
- Sitemap.xml update to include agent pages

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- Proper error logging for 500 errors
