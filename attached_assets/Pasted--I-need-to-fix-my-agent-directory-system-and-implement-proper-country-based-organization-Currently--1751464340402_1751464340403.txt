"I need to fix my agent directory system and implement proper country-based organization. Currently having several issues that need immediate resolution.

**CURRENT PROBLEMS TO FIX:**

1. **Agent Directory Not Showing Approved Agents:**
   - /agents page shows "0 Verified Agents" even after approving agents
   - Approved agents not appearing in the agent list
   - Need to fix the database query to show only approved agents

2. **404 Error on Agent Pages:**
   - Agent page URLs are malformed: /agents/new agent/ (with spaces)
   - Need proper URL slug generation without spaces
   - Agent pages returning 404 errors

3. **URL Structure Reorganization:**
   - Current: /agents/[agent-slug]
   - Wanted: /agents/[country]/[agent-slug]
   - Example: /agents/united-states/john-smith or /agents/poland/maria-kowalski

**NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:**

**1. COUNTRY-BASED AGENT ORGANIZATION:**
- Reorganize agent pages by country: /agents/[country]/[agent-slug]
- Add country field to agent registration form
- Update database schema to include country information
- Generate country-specific slugs (e.g., "united-states", "poland", "germany")

**2. FUNCTIONAL AGENT SEARCH SYSTEM:**
Make the search on /agents page fully functional:
- Search by agent name (first name + last name)
- Search by city
- Search by company name
- Country filter dropdown with actual countries from database

**Database Changes Needed:**

- Fix: GET /agents/[country]/[agent-slug] (country-based agent pages)

- Add: GET /api/agents/search (search functionality)

**5. URL SLUG GENERATION FIX:**

- Format: "first-name-last-name" (all lowercase, hyphens only)
- Country slugs: "united-states", "poland", "germany", etc.

**6. SEO IMPROVEMENTS FOR COUNTRY PAGES:**
- Create country-specific SEO meta tags
- Title: "[Agent Name] - Crypto Real Estate Agent in [Country] | HomeKrypto"
- Description: "Connect with [Agent Name], licensed crypto real estate professional in [Country]. Invest in property with cryptocurrency through HomeKrypto."
- Keywords: "crypto real estate [country], cryptocurrency property investment [country], [agent name]"

**7. EMAIL NOTIFICATION FIX:**
