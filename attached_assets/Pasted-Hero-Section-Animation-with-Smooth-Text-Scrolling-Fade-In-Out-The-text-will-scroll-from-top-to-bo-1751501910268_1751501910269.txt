Hero Section Animation with Smooth Text Scrolling & Fade-In/Out:
The text will scroll from top to bottom, shrinking as it moves down and changing with each scroll.

Here’s an example of how we can achieve this:

js
Copy
Edit
import gsap from 'gsap';
import ScrollTrigger from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';

// Register ScrollTrigger plugin
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

// Hero Section Animation
function heroTextScrolling() {

    // Main scrolling text animation (appears from top)
    gsap.from(".hero-section .hero-text", {
        scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: ".hero-section",
            start: "top top",
            end: "bottom top",
            scrub: true,
            pin: true, // Keeps the section pinned as you scroll
            markers: false, // Remove markers after testing
        },
        yPercent: -50,  // Start from the top of the screen (moves down)
        opacity: 0,
        scale: 2,  // Starts large for impact
        duration: 1.5,
        ease: "power3.out"
    });

    // Text shrinking and message transition (as you scroll)
    gsap.to(".hero-section .hero-text", {
        scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: ".hero-section",
            start: "top bottom",
            end: "top center",
            scrub: true,
        },
        scale: 0.8,  // Shrink the text
        opacity: 0.7,  // Fade text out as you scroll
        duration: 1.5,
        ease: "power3.out"
    });

    // Change Text Dynamically as User Scrolls (Text "reveals" or "changes")
    gsap.to(".hero-section .hero-text span", {
        scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: ".hero-section",
            start: "top top",
            end: "bottom center",
            scrub: true,
        },
        opacity: 1,  // Gradually show new text
        duration: 1.5,
        ease: "power3.out",
        stagger: 0.2  // Make the new text appear staggered for a smooth transition
    });

    // Background Image Parallax (for more depth)
    gsap.to(".hero-section .background-image", {
        scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: ".hero-section",
            start: "top bottom",
            end: "bottom top",
            scrub: true,
        },
        yPercent: 30,
        ease: "none"
    });
}

// Initialize Hero Section Scroll Animation
window.addEventListener("load", heroTextScrolling);
Breakdown of Features & Scroll Effects:
Text Scroll Animation (Hero Text):

The hero message scrolls down from top to bottom using the yPercent property.

The text starts larger (to create impact) and shrinks as the user scrolls down.

The opacity of the text also reduces slightly to create a subtle fading effect.

Dynamic Text Change:

Each segment of the hero text can change dynamically as the user scrolls. For instance, the first part of the text could say:

"We do investing in real estate much better than others".

As the user scrolls, the next part of the message appears:

"Our innovative plan of shares in two weeks".

This text can be wrapped in <span> elements and controlled through GSAP animations.

Background Parallax:

A parallax effect for the background image, creating a subtle 3D feel as users scroll. This would make the background scroll at a different rate than the content, providing depth.

Pinned Hero Section:

The section could be "pinned" using the ScrollTrigger pin: true property. This means that while scrolling, the hero section will stay fixed in place for a while and the text and elements will scroll over it.

Staggered Text Effects:

To make the text feel like it’s gradually revealing itself, the stagger property ensures that each part of the message fades or appears one after another.

Hero Section HTML & CSS:
Here’s a quick structure to accompany the animations above:

HTML:

<div class="hero-section">
    <div class="background-image">
        <!-- Optional Background Image -->
    </div>
    <div class="hero-text">
        <span class="line">We do investing in real estate much better than others.</span>
        <span class="line">Our innovative plan of shares in two weeks will revolutionize the market.</span>
        <span class="line">Experience seamless, transparent, and secure real estate investments with us.</span>

.hero-section {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.hero-text {
    font-size: 3rem;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.5;
    opacity: 0; /* Start hidden */
    position: relative;
}

.hero-text .line {
    display: block;
    opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */
    transform: translateY(50px); /* Start off-screen */
}

.background-image {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-image: url('your-background-image.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    z-index: -1; /* Ensure text is above background */
}
What Makes This Unique:
Smooth, progressive text scroll: As the user scrolls down, the text evolves and changes, rather than simply moving in from the sides. The idea is that the text tells a story as the user scrolls, which is more interactive.

Hero section focus: It grabs attention immediately without the need for complicated 3D animations but uses the power of text animation and dynamic visual changes.

Visual depth: The parallax background creates a rich sense of space, making the section feel more immersive.

Additional Considerations:
Font Size and Responsive Layout: Adjust the font size depending on the screen size to ensure that text is easily readable on mobile devices.

Mobile Optimization: Ensure that the scrolling effect and animations are smooth and responsive on mobile.

Loading Speed: Optimize the images used for the background to prevent slow loading times, especially for the parallax effect.

How This Will Help:
This type of dynamic hero section with scroll-triggered text and smooth animations will make the first impression on users extremely engaging. It immediately communicates your innovative approach to real estate investment, and by making it interactive, you’ll keep visitors hooked and make them want to explore more.
