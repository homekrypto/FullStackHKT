The property creation system currently lacks agent assignment functionality, and the properties listing page displays static dummy data instead of real property records from the database. We need to create a complete integration between the existing agent system and property management system.
Required Implementation Changes
1. Database Schema Enhancement
Task: Modify the properties table to establish a foreign key relationship with the agents table.

Add agent_id field to properties table with foreign key constraint to agents table
Ensure proper indexing for performance when querying properties by agent
Update any existing properties to handle null agent_id values during transition

2. Property Creation Form Enhancement
Backend API Changes:

Create new endpoint to fetch all approved agents for dropdown population
Modify existing property creation endpoint to accept and validate agent_id parameter
Add server-side validation to ensure selected agent exists and is approved
Update property creation response to include agent information

Frontend Form Changes:

Add agent selection dropdown to property creation form
Implement dynamic loading of approved agents from API
Add form validation to ensure agent selection is required
Update form submission to include selected agent ID

3. Property Display System Overhaul
Backend API Updates:

Modify property retrieval endpoints to join with agents table
Include agent information (name, contact, location) in property response objects
Add filtering capability to return only active properties
Create endpoint for real-time property count statistics

Frontend Display Updates:

Update property cards/listings to display agent information
Format agent display as "Local Representative for Home Krypto"
Include agent contact details and location information
Ensure responsive design maintains visual hierarchy

4. Properties Page Data Integration
API Integration:

Replace all hardcoded dummy data with dynamic database queries
Connect property count display to real database count of active properties
Implement proper error handling for empty states
Add loading states while fetching real data

Content Management:

Maintain existing marketing sections (Featured Property, Global Portfolio, Why Our Properties Excel, How Property Investment Works, Ready to Start sections)
Only replace the active properties listing and count
Ensure SEO optimization remains intact for static content

Testing Requirements
Unit Testing

Test agent dropdown population under various scenarios (no agents, multiple agents, API failures)
Validate property creation with agent assignment
Test property queries with agent joins for performance
Verify data integrity constraints for agent-property relationships

Integration Testing

End-to-end property creation flow with agent selection
Properties page loading with real data
Agent information display accuracy across all property views
Database transaction handling for concurrent property creations

User Acceptance Testing

Admin can create properties with agent assignment
Properties display correctly with agent information
Property count reflects actual database state
Page performance remains acceptable with real data loading

Expected Outcomes

Property creation form includes functional agent selection dropdown
All property listings show assigned agent as "Local Representative for Home Krypto"
Properties page displays actual database properties instead of dummy data
Active property count is dynamically generated from database
Existing marketing sections remain unchanged and functional

Priority Order

Database schema updates (foundational)
Backend API modifications (core functionality)
Property creation form enhancement (user workflow)
Properties page data integration (public-facing)
